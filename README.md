Computing IV Projects.  
All projects written by:  
Scott Gordon  
  
Each project utilizes the SFML library.  
I used Homebrew to install, if you use another method, you may need to change the Makefile for each project.  

To build and run each project, a Makefile is provided.  
Run the command 'Make', and an executable will be provided.  
Run the command 'Make clean', and the folder will be cleaned of the executable and object files.
