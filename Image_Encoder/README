Image encoder and decoder  
Scott Gordon  

Similar to other programs in this repository, you must have the SFML library installed.  

To run, provide four command line arguments after running 'make'.  
    1. Image name  
    2. Output image name  
    3. Binary random seed (string of 1's and 0's)  
    4. Tap position  

When decoding, provide the same random seed and tap position to get back the origian image.  
An image of my cat Simba is provided for some sample input :)  

Sample input:  
./PhotoMagic Simba.png Simba-out.png 10010011101 4  
./PhotoMagic Simba-out.png Simba-new.png 10010011101 4
