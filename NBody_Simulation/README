NBody Simulation  
Scott Gordon  

Similar to other programs in this repository, you must have the SFML library installed.  

To run, provide three command line arguments after running 'make'.  
    1. Duration of the simulation  
    2. Simulation time increment  

To properly run, you must also redirect from the file 'planets.txt' to standard input.  
Some other sample input files are provided for different experiences.  

After running, the state of the universe is stored in 'output.txt', and this file can be used as input again.  

Example inputs:  
./NBody 1577880000.0 5000.0 < data/planets.txt  
./NBody 1577880000.0 5000.0 < data/planets-elliptical.txt
